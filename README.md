# SentimentalAnalysis
1. This is the project that i had worked as a part of my summer internship at Dailyhunt. Dailyhunt is an Indian Content and News App which frequently requires user sentiment to bring out the most relevant news to      users.
2. Developed a sentiment analysis pipeline, leveraging the YouTube Data API and Reddit API to extract captions of YouTube videos and 
   Reddit posts and classify the sentiment of videos and posts respectively.
3. Implemented preprocessing techniques using the NLTK and VADER libraries.
4. Applied transfer learning to a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification.
5. Designed and deployed a Streamlit-based web application enabling users to input YouTube channels or Reddit subreddits, and visualize
   sentiment analysis results in a specified date range.
